\begin{abstract}
    This is a sandbox file, which just means a file where anyone can
    play in the sand. That is anyone can play around with bits of tex
    code before adding them to the main tex file. Hi, this is
    Hari. This is Daniel.

\section{Commutative diagrams}
Here is a sample commutative diagram in Tikz. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$ \partial D^n $};
		\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$ D^n $};
		\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$ X $};
		\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$ Y $};
		\draw [{Hooks[right]}->] (LT) -- node [left] {$ i $} (LB);
		\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$ \overline{\alpha} $} (RT);
		\draw [->>] (RT) -- node [right] {$ f $} (RB);
		\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$ \alpha $} (RB);
		
		\draw [->, dashed] (LB) -- node [above left] {$  $} (RT);
		% for adding pullback/pushout symbols
		%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};  
		%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
